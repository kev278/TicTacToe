Steps to run the code on Linux
Assumption: G++ is installed on Linux
Step 1: Extract the folder in any location
Step 2: Open a terminal and go to the extracted folder TicTacToe
For example: cd Desktop/TicTacToe
Step 3: g++ TicTacToe.cpp -o TicTacToe
This tells the compiler to make an executable for the TicTacToe.cpp file and the executable is named TicTacToe
Step 4: ./TicTacToe
This runs the .cpp file
